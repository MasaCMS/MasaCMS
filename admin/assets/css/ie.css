	Linking Mura CMS statically or dynamically with other modules constitutes the preparation of a derivative work based on

	However, as a special exception, the copyright holders of Mura CMS grant you permission to combine Mura CMS with programs

	In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of Mura CMS grant you permission to combine Mura CMS with 
	independent software modules (plugins, themes and bundles), and to distribute these plugins, themes and bundles without 
	Mura CMS under the license of your choice, provided that you follow these specific guidelines: 
	
	Your custom code 
	
	• Must not alter any default objects in the Mura CMS database and
	• May not alter the default display of the Mura CMS logo within Mura CMS and
	• Must not alter any files in the following directories.
	
	 /admin/
	 /tasks/
	 /config/
	 /core/mura/
	 /Application.cfc
	 /index.cfm

	You may copy and distribute Mura CMS with a plug-in, theme or bundle that meets the above guidelines as a combined work 
	under the terms of GPL for Mura CMS, provided that you include the source code of that other code when and as the GNU GPL

version 1.11
- extracted language into resource file

version 1.10
- combined most of cffmUDF.cfm and cffmConfig.cfm into a cffm.cfc
- image.cfc cannot handle formats other than jpg so the manipulate
  link will only appear for jpg images.
  It was originally hardcoded to output only jpg files.
- integrated FCK editor version for files and images with main version,
  and customized for use with both fckEditor and TinyMCE
- Removed image dimensions from file list due to scalability issues.
- file manager uses session or cookie to remember previous directory.
  useful when used as a file browser for an html editor.
- file list now sorted alphabetically, with directories appearing first.
- added some css to input buttons.
- Total disk usage removed to enhance speed for large directory
  structures.  Total disk usage was being calculated every page pull.
  Added "Show total disk usage here" link instead
- fixed nasty bug involving the delete (and other) links with filenames
  containing special characters.

version 1.00
 - modified cffmConfig.cfm to include .js and .css files as editable
 - Changed create new file form - eliminated radio buttons.  I kept
   creating directories when I meant to create a new file. 
 - KNOWN ISSUE:  Apparently, there is a bug in BlueDragon 6.1 which
   prevents the use of the ZIP functionality.  BlueDragon 6.2 will
   allegedly solve this.
 - combined standard CFFM and CFFM4FCK into one package for ease
   of distribution.  Distribution now includes cffm_fck_link.cfm and
   cffm_fck_image.cfm, used for image and link browsers within FCK editor.
